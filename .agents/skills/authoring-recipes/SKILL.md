# Authoring Recipes

Guidelines for writing fullstackrecipes content. This skill is for maintainers building out the fullstackrecipes project itself, not for developers consuming the stack (see `use-fullstackrecipes` for that).

fullstackrecipes is a site that helps developers and agents build better full stack apps by shipping an opinionated stack with setup instructions, best practices, and ready-to-clone starting points. It exposes four kinds of resources: **setup recipes**, **skills**, **cookbooks**, and **templates**.

## Two Skill Directories — Don't Confuse Them

This repo contains two separate `skills/` trees. They serve opposite audiences:

- **`./skills/`** — the skills this repo **exposes/ships** to consumers. These are the day-to-day, agent-facing workflow guides (`drizzle-queries`, `authentication-best-practices`, `workflow-best-practices`, etc.) that the website reads (and serves as Markdown via the `.md` endpoints) and that consumers install via `bunx skills add`. When this skill says "a skill," it means one of these.
- **`./.agents/skills/`** — the skills used **internally by this workspace** to build the fullstackrecipes project. This very `authoring-recipes` skill lives here. These are not exposed to consumers and are not part of the resource catalog.

When authoring or editing an exposed skill, you edit it under `./skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. Never put consumer-facing skill content in `.agents/skills/`.

## Recipe Tiers

Every catalog item is one of three tiers, plus an optional template attached to a cookbook. The tier determines what it installs and what its prose may assume. The single source of truth for the catalog (slugs, titles, descriptions, tags, `requires`, and template links) is `src/lib/recipes/data.tsx`.

### Tier 1 — Setup recipes (`type: "setup"`)

One-time setup that installs files, dependencies, and config for a single concern (e.g. `neon-drizzle-setup`, `better-auth-setup`).

- **Install surface stays atomic.** A setup recipe installs only its own slice so the dependency graph stays composable and individual recipes can be adopted standalone.
- **Declare prerequisites in `requires` and state them up front.** Reference the prereq; do not re-teach it. A minimal fallback for one or two missing prereqs is fine. Standalone usability lives here, not in the skill tier.

### Tier 2 — Skills (`type: "skill"`)

Day-to-day, agent-facing workflow guides for an already-configured tool (e.g. `drizzle-queries`, `authentication-best-practices`). These are the skills this repo exposes; they live under `./skills/` (not `.agents/skills/` — see above).

- **Skills are authored, not recipe docs.** The source of truth is the hand-authored `./skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + body). The website reads their body directly from that file (and serves it via the `.md` endpoints), so edits ship as soon as they land — there is no build step. They have no `docs/recipes/<slug>.md`.
- **Lead with `### ` body sections.** The loader (`src/lib/recipes/loader.ts`) strips the YAML frontmatter and everything up to the first `### ` heading, then re-derives the `# Title`, description, and a `## Prerequisites` list from `data.tsx` metadata. So the authored file leads with `# Title` + description + prereqs for standalone reading, but the shipped body starts at the first `### ` section. Use `### ` for your top-level body sections.
- **Name skills for what they teach, not the tool they wrap.** Use a descriptive slug and title (`drizzle-queries`, `testing-best-practices`, `ralph-loop-workflow`), not a `using-*` prefix. The `name:` frontmatter and the slug (folder name) must match, and the `# Title` H1 must match the `title` in `src/lib/recipes/data.tsx`. When renaming a slug, add the old slug to `recipeRedirects` in `data.tsx`.
- **The `type` is derived from the `Skills` tag.** An item becomes a skill (`type: "skill"`) when its `tags` include `"Skills"` in `data.tsx`; everything else is a setup recipe. There is no separate `type` field to set.
- **Write for an agent, not a human tutorial.** Lead with the pattern and the code; skip hand-holding prose, "step 1/2/3" walkthroughs, and motivation paragraphs the agent already understands. Imperative, concise, example-first.
- **Assume the canonical stack. Do not hedge.** Write to the exact world the setup recipes produce. Import from the real paths (`@/lib/db/client`, `@/lib/auth/server`, `@/lib/logging/logger`, `@/components/ui/*`, etc.). Never add "if you set this up differently" caveats — that defensive framing is what dilutes a skill's value.
- The canonical stack is defined by capability, not by cookbook name: a Postgres database via Drizzle, Better Auth sessions, structured logging, shadcn/ui components, and the test harness. A skill may assume any capability its `requires` chain provides.
- **Never reference back to how the stack was set up.** A skill only teaches how to _do the thing_ at runtime. Do not name-drop the setup recipe ("set up by the X recipe", "configured in Y", "from the Z setup") — it adds nothing while the skill is running. The `requires` metadata already tracks the setup trail and is surfaced as a Prerequisites section, so the body never needs to.
- Skills are **installed via the skills CLI**, not pasted as content. They persist as agent skills for ongoing work.

### Tier 3 — Cookbooks (`isCookbook: true`)

The canonical assembled reference: an ordered, two-phase setup artifact (see below).

## Authoring Cookbooks

A cookbook is a **setup artifact**, not a reading bundle. Running a cookbook leaves the project with both the configured stack and the installed skills.

### Two-phase model

1. **Setup chain** — the setup recipes, run in order, install files/deps/config.
2. **Skill install** — the skills are installed via `bunx skills add` so the agent retains the day-to-day patterns afterward.

### Ordering

List each skill **right after its setup recipe**, not all skills at the end. The skill follows the thing it teaches you to use.

### Rendering (handled automatically)

When a cookbook is assembled, the loader branches on `type`:

- **Setup recipes** inline their full content.
- **Skill recipes** render as a compact section: `## <title>` + motivation (the description) + the `bunx skills add ... -s <slug>` command. Their content is **not** inlined — the cookbook installs them as skills.

So you do not duplicate skill content into a cookbook. Just include the skill slug in `recipes` in the right position; the install section is generated from its metadata.

## Templates

Templates are clone-and-go starting points that ship the fully-assembled output of a cookbook, so a consumer can begin from working code instead of running every setup step by hand. They are not a separate catalog tier — a template is **attached to a cookbook** via two fields in `data.tsx`:

- `template` — the git clone path, built from `TEMPLATE_BASE` (e.g. `` `${TEMPLATE_BASE}/base-app#main` ``).
- `githubUrl` — the GitHub URL for browsing the template source, built from `GITHUB_TEMPLATE_BASE`.

The template source lives under `templates/<name>/` at the repo root and is a real, runnable project. A cookbook that surfaces a clonable starter also carries the `"Starter template"` tag (see `getStarterTemplates`); `base-app`, `auth`, `stripe-sync`, and `ai-workflow` are the current ones.

Authoring rules:

- **Keep the template in sync with its cookbook.** A template must reflect the exact output of running its cookbook's recipes in order. When you change a setup recipe, update the matching template directory too, or the clone-and-go path drifts from the documented one.
- **Templates are the assembled stack, not docs.** Don't add tutorial prose or recipe markdown into a template — it ships as a working app (with its own `agents.md`, `.agents/skills/`, etc.), and the prose lives in the recipes/cookbook.
- **Point at templates from the cookbook, don't duplicate them.** Only set `template` / `githubUrl` on the cookbook; the website renders the clone command from that metadata.

## Installable Utilities

When writing recipes that include installable utilities, use the `{% registry %}` tag to provide both CLI installation and source code viewing.

### Registry Tag

The registry tag renders:

1. **Install via shadcn CLI** - A copy-able command to install the utility
2. **Source code viewer** - Collapsible code block showing the full source

Example usage:

```markdoc
{% registry items="assert" /%}
```

This renders the CLI command and source code from `public/r/assert.json`. Users can install via CLI or copy the code directly.

### Avoid Code Duplication

When using a registry tag, **do not duplicate the code** in the recipe. The registry tag handles displaying the source code automatically.

Bad:

```markdoc
{% registry items="workflow-stream" /%}

Install via the registry above, or create manually:

\`\`\`typescript
// src/workflows/steps/stream.ts
// ... same code as registry item ...
\`\`\`
```

Good:

```markdoc
{% registry items="workflow-stream" /%}

Import and use the stream utilities in your workflow:

\`\`\`typescript
import { startStream, finishStream } from "@/workflows/steps/stream";
\`\`\`
```

The registry tag already provides the installation command and source code. Only add usage examples or explanations that aren't part of the installable code itself.
